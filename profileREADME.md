When Is Moana 2 Release Date?
Treat them the same way you treat us! How dare you?!” are some of the screams I’ve been getting from traditional major studios when it comes to the chilly box office performance of the Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans $200M Christmas action movie Moana 2. (“No! It’s $250M!” exclaims an Amazon vet with knowledge). And at an opening of $34M, after a $10.9M Friday, and even a Saturday family lift of $13.2M, we can’t ignore the fact that we’ve seen better from The Rock, as far as his solo non-Fast & Furious projects go. EntTelligence says that only 2.4M people watched Moana 2 this weekend — which ain’t much.
The movie’s A- CinemaScore is better than Johnson’s Black Adam and Skyscraper‘s B+s and the same as Rampage. The 88% on Rotten Tomatoes from audiences is the same as Black Adam. Comscore/Screen Engine audiences were harder with 78% positive, 57% definite recommend with kids under 12 better at 91% and 51% must-see right away. Best demos were 18-24 and over 55 at 20% apiece. Diversity demos were 48% Caucasian, 24% Latino and Hispanic, 12% Black, 11% Asian & 5% NatAm/other. Imax and PLF drove 38% of the gross. Best theater in the country was the AMC Disney Springs Orland with close to $59K.
But, damn, if this isn’t a high budget. That’s the biggest problem here with Moana 2 overall. However, that’s what you get when you do business with the industrial complex that is the Rock. The gossip can cry tardiness, entourages, water bottles, schedules, studio execs asleep at the wheel and an exorbitant amount of jelly beans in Rock’s trailer — it doesn’t matter. Capisce? This is what it costs to get into business with Johnson, and the only ones who are bold enough to invest in this endeavor are streamers like Netflix with Red Notice and Amazon MGM Studios here with Moana 2. The Rock has yet to scale down the budget of one of his tentpoles.
First, to placate the irate, traditional model studio brass who want to put Moana 2 side-by-side with the performance of Joker: Folie a Deux, let’s recognize the fact here that this opening for Moana 2 is on the lower end of Johnson’s original IP, higher than Skyscraper ($130M production cost yielding $24.9M domestic opening, $68.4M domestic final, worldwide was $304.8M booted by $98M+ from China) but lower than San Andreas ($54.4M). There’s an argument to be made that the movie in its execution is more like a lightweight Lethal Weapon for audiences than a family film, which is why we’re not seeing a rush from the latter audience.
